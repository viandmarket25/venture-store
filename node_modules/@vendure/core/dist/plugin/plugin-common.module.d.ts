 *
 * * `EventBusModule`, allowing the injection of the {@link EventBus} service.
 * * `ServiceModule` allowing the injection of any of the various entity services such as ProductService, OrderService etc.
 * * `ConfigModule`, allowing the injection of the ConfigService.
 * * `JobQueueModule`, allowing the injection of the {@link JobQueueService}.
 * * `HealthCheckModule`, allowing the injection of the {@link HealthCheckRegistryService}.
