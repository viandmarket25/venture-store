     * The score is derived from the sum of the priorityValues of the PromotionConditions and

     *
     * An example illustrating the need for a priority is this:
     *
     *
     * Consider 2 Promotions, 1) buy 1 get one free and 2) 10% off when order total is over $50.
     * If Promotion 2 is evaluated prior to Promotion 1, then it can trigger the 10% discount even
     * if the subsequent application of Promotion 1 brings the order total down to way below $50.
