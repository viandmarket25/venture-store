/**
 * @description
 * This is a helper class which is used to "hydrate" entity instances, which means to populate them
 * with the specified relations. This is useful when writing plugin code which receives an entity
 * and you need to ensure that one or more relations are present.
 *
 * @example
 * ```TypeScript
 * const product = await this.productVariantService
 *   .getProductForVariant(ctx, variantId);
 *
 * await this.entityHydrator
 *   .hydrate(ctx, product, { relations: ['facetValues.facet' ]});
 *```
 *
 * In this above example, the `product` instance will now have the `facetValues` relation
 * available, and those FacetValues will have their `facet` relations joined too.
 *
 * This `hydrate` method will _also_ automatically take care or translating any
 * translatable entities (e.g. Product, Collection, Facet), and if the `applyProductVariantPrices`
 * options is used (see {@link HydrateOptions}), any related ProductVariant will have the correct
 * Channel-specific prices applied to them.
 *
 * Custom field relations may also be hydrated:
 *
 * @example
 * ```TypeScript
 * const customer = await this.customerService
 *   .findOne(ctx, id);
 *
 * await this.entityHydrator
 *   .hydrate(ctx, customer, { relations: ['customFields.avatar' ]});
 * ```
