/**
 * @description
 * An extension of the {@link DefaultAssetNamingStrategy} which prefixes file names with
 * the type (`'source'` or `'preview'`) as well as a 2-character sub-directory based on
 * the md5 hash of the original file name.
 *
 * This is an implementation of the technique knows as "hashed directory" file storage,
 * and the purpose is to reduce the number of files in a single directory, since a very large
 * number of files can lead to performance issues when reading and writing to that directory.
 *
 * With this strategy, even with 200,000 total assets stored, each directory would
 * only contain less than 800 files.
